          It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
          wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
          was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
          season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
          despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we
          were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other
          wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some
          of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good
          or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
